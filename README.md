# TinyLoom

Where other looms focus on features, TinyLoom focuses on simplicity and shareability.

Do some looming, then click download. You wont get some nasty json file, you'll get an index.html that contains your data and an entire loom to run it with. Simples.

Try it with [the hermes prompt](https://minihf.com/posts/2023-04-13-hermes-prompt/).

You need a key from [Together](https://www.together.ai/). They give you $20 tho. (I'll add OpenAI eventually, but they shut down all the base models so I'm not in a rush.)
